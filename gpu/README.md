# Glyd weights on the GPU

A bf16 model's weights held compressed in VRAM, decoded on the GPU bit
for bit. A bf16 weight is a sign, 8 exponent bits and 7 mantissa bits;
in a trained model the sign and mantissa are noise, and the exponent
carries about 2.6 bits of information. Both formats keep the sign and
mantissa byte as it is and code the exponent:

| Format | Exponent | Bits a weight (Qwen2.5) | Decode |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| `huffman` (`pack`) | per-tensor Huffman code, 32 streams a tile | 10.84 | a lane decodes its stream in turn |
| `fast` (`pack_fast`) | 3-bit code into the tensor's 7 most common exponents, an escape to the exponent itself | 11.25 | bit operations, every weight in parallel |

The floor for any code that sees each tensor's exponents on their own
is about 10.6 bits a weight.

For one-token steps (generation) the product is fused: `fast_gemv` and
`gemv` read the packed weights, decode them in registers and multiply,
never writing bf16 out. Otherwise a matrix is decoded into one scratch
buffer and multiplied by PyTorch (`unpack`, `fast_unpack`).

## Measured

RTX 4080 SUPER (16 GB), PyTorch 2.14, CUDA 13.0; Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,
greedy, 128 new tokens (`e2e.py`):

| | Peak VRAM | Tokens/s | Tokens as bf16's |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| bf16 | 15.25 GB | 43.3 | |
| `fast`, fused | **11.05 GB** | **55.1** | 128 of 128 |
| `huffman`, fused | 10.57 GB | 32.9 | |
| `fast`, decoded then PyTorch's matmul | 11.05 GB | 18.3 | 128 of 128 |

The fused `fast` product on 7B's matrices (`shapes.py`): 663–696 GB/s of
packed weights, 1.29–1.47x bf16's matrix-vector time (the small key and
value projections, which sit in L2, 0.66x). The fused product sums in
another order than cuBLAS, as any two GEMM kernels do; the decoded path
multiplies with PyTorch's own kernel and gives bf16's logits bit for bit
where a matrix is decoded whole (Qwen2.5-0.5B: logits and 128 tokens
identical; the 7B output layer is decoded in blocks to cap the scratch).

## Running

Needs PyTorch with CUDA and nvcc (the extension builds on first import):

    python check.py model.safetensors         # every tensor packed, unpacked, compared; speeds
    python shapes.py MODEL_DIR                # fused product against bf16, one layer's matrices
    python e2e.py MODEL_DIR --format fast --fused --baseline
